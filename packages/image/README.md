# Minima Image Handbook

This package is made to facilitate image composability across the Minima dApp eco-system.  

It has both a re-usable React component labelled `Image` and utility methods that can be used independently especially useful for processing, compressing, and fetching images from various sources, including base64 encodings and IPFS/IPNS.

The `Image` tag that can be imported by `import { Image } from "@minima-global/image"` and then using it like:


` <Image src={(minimaToken.url} /> `

Otherwise you can have a look at how the Image component was built using the utility functions in the `/utils` folder part of the package.
